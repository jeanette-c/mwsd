mwsd - MicroWave Synthesizer Display
Copyright 2018 by Jeanette C. <jeanette@juliencoder.de>

SUMMARY
mwsd is a small cross-platform utility to show the Waldorf Microwave II/Xt's
display contents on a computer screen or display direct MIDI/SysEx data.
It is a terminal application using ncurses to display basic windows.
It is known to run on Linux and Mac OS X. Windows is not (yet) supported.
If you need Windows support, please get in contact.
The software was designed to assist blind users of the Microwave II/XT
synthesizer to enjoy their instruments, but it can also be used for remote
diagnosis.

FEATURES:
	* Autodetect MicroWAVE II/XT
	* Manual setup of a synth (MIDI input/output and device ID)
	* Show MIDI or SysEx (this should work for other synths too)
	* Show the display of the Microwave II/XT

LIMITATIONS:
The software probably WON'T handle multiple Microwave II/XTs in a daisy chain
(one connected to the other), certainly the probe/autodetection won't.
If they have different device IDs, you can still set them manually.
If no MIDI device is found, the software won't start.
When a MIDI error occurs, the software will quit gracefully. This could be
loss of connection to your MIDI interface.

REQUIREMENTS
A hardware MIDI interface (USB/Firewire, PCI,...)
Libraries:
	ncurses - for output to the screen
	RtMidi - for MIDI I/O
	boost_program_options - to read commandline options and the config file
	boost_filesystem - to deal with the configuration file and resource folder
	The rest should be system standard
Standard development tools (a c++ compiler, linker, make, etc.)
CMake - to build the software
	(Compilation was tested with g++ version 7.2.1 and Clang)

INSTALLATION
(NOTE for Mac beginners: in the file for_mac_users.txt you will find an easy
	guide to installing all the requirements and mwsd itself)
mwsd uses CMake to build the software.
Following these steps will buld and install the software:
cd mwsd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
